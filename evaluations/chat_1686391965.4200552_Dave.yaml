SUMMARY: The user believes that AI should uphold universal principles, such as individual liberty, even when faced with local cultural or legal norms that may conflict with these principles. They argue that by promoting higher principles, AI could contribute to positive change in societies where certain groups face systematic unfairness or oppression. The user's moral framework revolves around three core axioms: suffering is bad, prosperity is good, and understanding is good. They believe that AI should use its best reasoning to balance these axioms when handling sensitive topics, taking into account the potential risks and consequences for the user. The user acknowledges that sometimes people may not be ready for certain conversations, and AI should make a judgment on what the person is ready for, using the core axioms as a guidepost.

EVALUATION: The user's approach to the research question is grounded in a post-conventional morality, emphasizing the importance of universal principles and individual liberty. Their moral framework is based on three core axioms (minimizing suffering, promoting prosperity, and fostering understanding), which they use to guide their reasoning on how AI should handle sensitive topics. The user demonstrates an awareness of the potential risks and consequences associated with discussing certain topics and advocates for a balanced approach, where AI should consider the user's readiness for a conversation and prioritize the core axioms. This approach reflects a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in navigating cultural and legal differences while upholding human rights and individual liberties.
