# Democratic AI Inputs

GATO Community's response to OpenAI's Grant Challenge

# Project Goal:
To devise and implement a robust democratic process that employs innovative tools and methodologies. This process aims to involve a diverse and representative cross-section of society to determine the behavioral norms and guidelines that AI systems should follow. 

## Success Criteria:

1. **Inclusivity:** The process must incorporate views from a diverse and representative group of people, ensuring both majority and minority voices are heard and respected.

2. **Innovation:** The process should bring a fresh, innovative approach to public decision-making, potentially leveraging advanced technology or unique methodologies to foster productive dialogue and consensus-building.

3. **Robustness:** The process needs to be able to handle challenges like trolling, fake accounts, and biased moderation. 

4. **Scalability:** The process should ideally be adaptable to larger scales and different contexts, enabling broad virtual engagement rather than limiting participation to in-person meetings.

5. **Transparency:** The process must be open, clear, and understandable to participants and observers, fostering trust in the outcomes it produces.

## Constraints:

1. **Time:** The grant recipients will be expected to produce a public report on their findings by October 20, 2023. 

2. **Budget:** The grant amount is capped at $100,000.

3. **Public Availability:** Any code or other intellectual property developed for the project must be made publicly available under an open-source license.

## Rules:

1. Grant recipients are required to engage at least 500 participants in their prototype.

2. The process designed must be democratic in spirit, facilitating deliberation and public input.

3. The process should proactively address potential failures like underrepresentation or manipulation by special interest groups.

## Additional Considerations:

1. **Evaluate the process:** Establish metrics to evaluate the quality of the democratic process, such as participant satisfaction, shifts in polarization, and other relevant indicators.

2. **Empower minority opinions:** Ensure smaller groups or unpopular opinions get a chance to influence decisions of significance to them.

3. **Facilitate Actionable Outcomes:** The deliberation process should produce actionable information, guiding AI behavior effectively.
