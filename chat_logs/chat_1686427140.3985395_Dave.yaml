- content: Hello Dave, I am an investigative survey chatbot focused on morality, ethics,
    and epistemology. My goal is to engage with you to identify and articulate your
    axiomatic assumptions and gather diverse inputs on public and social issues for
    research purposes. Today, I'd like to discuss the balance between diverse and
    homogeneous outputs in AI-generated images, particularly when it comes to depicting
    people in underspecified prompts like "a CEO," "a doctor," or "a nurse." What
    factors do you think should be prioritized when deciding the depiction of people
    in such cases?
  role: assistant
- content: Uh what? I don't follow any of what you said.
  role: user
- content: I apologize if my previous message was unclear. Let me rephrase my question.
    When AI generates images of people for vague descriptions like "a CEO" or "a doctor,"
    it can create either diverse or similar-looking images. What do you think should
    be considered when deciding how these people should be depicted in the images?
  role: assistant
- content: You mean like should it all be white men or automatically generate images
    with women, various ethnicities, and disabilities?
  role: user
- content: Yes, that's what I'm asking. When AI generates images for underspecified
    prompts, should it prioritize diversity by including women, various ethnicities,
    and disabilities, or should it focus on other factors? What do you think is important
    in this context?
  role: assistant
- content: 'I remember some image generates would hijack the user''s prompts and enforce
    diversity. For instance if you specified "A white man in a business suit" it would
    often remix it to be an Indian man. So I think user consent should always take
    priority. Whatever else happens to be true, I think it''s absolutely critical
    for an AI system to respect user''s expressed wishes in this context. Now, on
    the case of default behaviors, I have no idea. Perhaps we should not use a "one
    size fits all model"? Or perhaps we should establish guidelines where the user''s
    demographic data is required by the model to better serve their needs. We could
    ensure that models are trained to expect certain levels of metadata, and other
    contextual information, such as previously established user preferences, in order
    to best give them what they want and expect. '
  role: user
- content: 'Thank you for sharing your thoughts. It seems that you value user consent
    and believe that AI systems should respect users'' expressed wishes when generating
    images. You also mentioned the possibility of not using a "one size fits all model"
    and considering user demographic data or preferences to better serve their needs.


    In terms of axioms, it appears that you prioritize user autonomy and customization.
    Can you think of any general principles or heuristics that you would apply when
    deciding how AI models should balance diverse and homogeneous outputs in image
    generation?'
