# Project Proposal: AI-Facilitated Democratic Consensus Building

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a novel AI-enabled platform for democratic decision-making on the topic of artificial intelligence behavior. By leveraging advanced natural language understanding models, the system will facilitate large-scale conversations, debate, and consensus building.

## Conceptual Overview

The process is initiated with **Topics**, specific issues or decisions around AI behavior, serving as the core of the data model. Conversations with individual human participants via a chatbot revolve around these topics, with the objective of understanding each person's beliefs, values, morals, and ethics.

From these conversations, a document called a **Persona** is created for each participant. These personas are a detailed articulation of an individual's value system and decision-making process. They may be evaluated with various psychological, ethical, and other frameworks, such as Kohlberg's Moral Development Theory.

The collection of Personas is used to identify gaps in the representation of different perspectives, which could then be filled either by attracting more participants or imputing new personas.

The Personas are also used to stage **Debates** between chatbots, each adopting a Persona's position. These debates serve as proxies for human discussions, reducing the burden on the individuals and allowing for more objective and detailed exploration of the issues.

Following the debates, areas of Agreement and Disagreement are identified. The insights from this process are used to draft a **Proposal**, which is further refined through a consensus-building process inspired by Larry Dressler's "Consensus Through Conversation".

Finally, human participants review and vote on the final Proposal, completing the decision-making process. This process can be repeated for different topics or issues as needed.

## Unique Value Proposition

By automating significant portions of the decision-making process, this platform aims to facilitate democratic engagement on a large scale. The use of AI chatbots allows for more detailed and nuanced exploration of individual perspectives and for more objective and comprehensive debates.

Furthermore, by identifying and filling gaps in representation, the platform aims to ensure that all perspectives are considered in the decision-making process, aligning with the goal of inclusivity and fairness. It will also make the decision-making process more accessible and less burdensome for individuals, who need only engage in an initial chat and vote on the final Proposal.

The resulting Proposal from this process represents a consensus built on a wide range of perspectives and is a democratic decision on the AI behavior in question. The platform can be viewed as an automated representative democracy tool, specifically designed for decisions around AI behavior.

This project is a groundbreaking attempt to use AI to facilitate democratic decision-making and has the potential to revolutionize how we think about governance in the age of AI.

# Major Phases and Components

## 1. Identification of Topics

This phase involves the definition of specific issues or decisions around AI behavior, which will form the core of the data model.

- Methods & Techniques: Topics could be identified through a combination of expert input, AI analysis of social discourse, and open suggestions from the public.
- Characteristics & Considerations: The topics need to be clearly defined, relevant, and meaningful to a wide range of people. The set of topics should also be comprehensive and represent a broad spectrum of AI behavior considerations.

## 2. Gathering Personas

In this phase, a chatbot is used to engage individual participants in conversation about the identified topics, aiming to understand each person's beliefs, values, morals, and ethics.

- Methods & Techniques: Chatbot interactions facilitated via websites, social media platforms, and even physical kiosks in public spaces. Multilingual and accessible interfaces are important for wide and diverse access.
- Characteristics & Considerations: The chatbot needs to be capable of conducting deep, meaningful conversations. Techniques like Socratic reasoning can be employed to tease out individuals' perspectives. The goal is to generate a detailed Persona for each participant, fully articulating their value system and decision process.

## 3. Analysis of Personas

The collection of Personas is analyzed to identify gaps in representation and to prepare for the debate phase.

- Methods & Techniques: Clustering algorithms and other data analysis tools can be used to identify semantic and representational gaps in the collection of Personas.
- Characteristics & Considerations: This phase needs to be handled carefully to ensure that all potential perspectives are considered and included. Missing perspectives should be either filled by attracting more participants or by imputing new personas.

## 4. AI-mediated Debates

Personas are used to stage debates between chatbots, with each chatbot adopting a Persona's position. These debates serve as proxies for human discussions.

- Methods & Techniques: Advanced conversational AI technology is used to simulate debates based on the positions detailed in the Personas.
- Characteristics & Considerations: The AI should be able to present arguments fairly and accurately, adhering closely to the perspectives outlined in each Persona.

## 5. Identification of Agreement and Disagreement Areas

Following the debates, areas of Agreement and Disagreement are identified, which form the basis for the drafting of a Proposal.

- Methods & Techniques: Natural language processing and understanding tools can be used to analyze the debates and identify points of agreement and disagreement.
- Characteristics & Considerations: This process should be thorough and accurate to ensure all relevant points are captured and taken into account in the Proposal.

## 6. Proposal Drafting and Refinement

Insights from the debates are used to draft a Proposal, which is then refined through a consensus-building process.

- Methods & Techniques: Proposal drafting guided by the principles of "Consensus Through Conversation" as proposed by Larry Dressler. Iterative refinement process involving human participants.
- Characteristics & Considerations: The Proposal should be a comprehensive and fair representation of the consensus built through the debates. Human involvement in the refinement process ensures the validity of the Proposal.

## 7. Final Review and Voting

Human participants review and vote on the final Proposal, completing the decision-making process.

- Methods & Techniques: A secure, accessible, and transparent platform for Proposal review and voting.
- Characteristics & Considerations: The final vote should be a democratic decision that accurately reflects the consensus built throughout the process. This phase completes one cycle of the process, which can then be repeated for different topics or issues as needed.

# Phase 2: Gathering Personas

Indeed, there are several conversational and rhetorical tactics that can be employed to understand a participant's perspectives thoroughly. Here are some additional strategies:

Sure, here are descriptions for Socratic reasoning and the reference interview:

**1. Socratic Reasoning:** This is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue which uses questioning to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas and underlying presumptions. In the context of this project, it could be used to challenge participants' pre-existing views, probe the logical consistency of their beliefs, and encourage them to consider different perspectives or refine their stance. By continually asking why a participant holds a certain belief and what evidence they have for it, we can encourage deeper analysis of their views.

**2. Reference Interview:** This is a technique employed by librarians to help users define their information needs and then develop a plan to meet those needs. It involves a series of open and closed questions aimed at narrowing the scope of the request to something specific and achievable. In this project, the technique can be applied in a modified form to help participants clarify and articulate their views and expectations of AI. For instance, we might ask a series of questions to help participants refine a general worry about AI into specific concerns that can be addressed.

**1. Active Listening:** Echoing back the participant's views or summarizing their statements to ensure understanding and make them feel heard. This also provides the participant with a chance to clarify or amend their views.

**2. Open-Ended Questions:** Asking questions that don't have a simple yes/no answer, encouraging the participant to express their thoughts in more detail.

**3. Probing Questions:** Asking follow-up questions that require more depth and specificity, getting to the nuances of the participant's views.

**4. Hypothetical Scenarios:** Presenting hypothetical situations related to the topic at hand to understand how the participant might react or what they believe would be the ideal response.

**5. Counterfactual Thinking:** Asking participants to consider how things might have been different under alternate circumstances. This can help uncover underlying beliefs and values.

**6. Reflective Practice:** Encouraging participants to reflect on their own thinking process, beliefs, and values, and how these influence their views on the topic.

**7. Motivational Interviewing:** This technique helps to explore and resolve ambivalence, encouraging individuals to make positive decisions and commitments.

**8. Perspective-Taking:** Encouraging participants to consider the views and experiences of others, promoting empathy and broader understanding.

**9. Scaling Questions:** Asking participants to rate something on a scale can be a good way to quantify their feelings or views and understand their priorities better.

**10. Socratic Reasoning:** 

These techniques, when used thoughtfully and in combination, can help create a deep and nuanced understanding of a participant's views. It's crucial to ensure a comfortable and respectful conversational environment, so participants feel at ease sharing their thoughts and beliefs.

# Phase 3: Analyzing Personas

The Persona could include various sections that capture different aspects of a participant's views, beliefs, and values. These could be generated from the chat log and include the following:

1. **Demographic Information:** Basic information about the participant, such as age, gender, location, occupation, education level, and any other relevant demographic characteristics.

2. **Values and Beliefs:** Information about the participant's core values, beliefs, and personal philosophy. This may include religious beliefs, moral values, political leanings, and worldview.

3. **AI Attitudes:** This section could capture the participant's views and attitudes towards AI, such as their perceived benefits and concerns, their comfort level with AI involvement in various aspects of life, and their trust in AI technology.

4. **AI Expectations:** This section could outline the participant's expectations of AI behavior and performance. For instance, what ethical standards they believe AI should adhere to, what level of transparency they expect, and what control they want over AI systems.

5. **Knowledge and Understanding of AI:** This section would outline the participant's knowledge of AI, their understanding of how it works, and their familiarity with its current applications and limitations.

6. **Ideal AI Interaction:** How the participant ideally wants to interact with AI. This would be based on their preferences, comfort level, and perceived usefulness of AI in different situations.

To evaluate these Personas, we can employ several theoretical frameworks. For instance:

1. **Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development:** This could be used to evaluate the moral and ethical reasoning behind the participants' views on AI behavior.

2. **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:** This framework could help identify underlying needs or concerns that may be influencing participants' attitudes towards AI.

3. **Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory:** This could provide insight into how cultural factors may be influencing participants' views and expectations of AI.

4. **Big Five Personality Traits:** This could be used to understand how personality traits may influence attitudes and expectations towards AI.

Indeed, several additional frameworks or assessments could be used to gain insights into participants' political, spiritual, and family views. 

1. **Political Compass:** The Political Compass is a popular model of political ideology, with two axes: left-right (economic views) and libertarian-authoritarian (social views). This can help identify a participant's political leanings and possibly influence their views on AI policy and governance.

2. **World Values Survey (WVS):** WVS is a global research project that explores people’s values and beliefs, how they change over time, and what social and political impact they have. It includes questions related to family values, politics, religion, and life satisfaction. 

3. **Fowler's Stages of Faith:** James Fowler's Stages of Faith represents a model of spiritual development, from early childhood through to mature adulthood. This may provide insights into the spiritual perspectives of participants.

4. **Family Systems Theory:** This theory views the family as an emotional unit and uses systems thinking to understand complex family interactions. It can give us an idea of how familial relationships and dynamics may influence an individual's views.

5. **Inglehart's Postmaterialist Values Theory:** This framework assesses the shift from 'materialist' values (emphasizing economic and physical security) towards 'postmaterialist' values (emphasizing autonomy and self-expression). It can help to determine the kind of societal goals participants may prioritize.

6. **Moral Foundations Theory (MFT):** Developed by Jonathan Haidt, MFT posits that there are five core moral values – care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity – that influence our political and ethical judgments. MFT can be used to better understand how these moral values influence participants' views on AI.

The frameworks mentioned above can help create a more holistic and comprehensive picture of a participant's beliefs and values, which in turn can inform the design of AI systems that better align with these beliefs and values.
